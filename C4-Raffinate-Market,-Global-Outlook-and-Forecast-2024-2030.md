Raffinate or C4 Raffinate or C4 residual is the residual product that remains after the separation of 1,3 Butadiene and 1-Butene from Mixed C4 stream. Because of the low Reid vapor pressure, it is preferred to natural gasoline in ethanol or gasoline mixes. Raffinate is majorly used to synthesize Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), which is a flammable substance. MTBE raises the octane and oxygen content of gasoline and works as a pollution-reducing compound in gasoline. Moreover, raffinate also finds application to synthesize Secondary butyl alcohol (SBA), a coupling agent in water-reducible coatings, industrial cleaners, and paint removers.

Isomolded graphite is a kind of graphite material that crystals are disorderly arranged while having an isotropic structure. Isomolded graphite is a ultra-fine grain graphite used for applications where the mechanical properties of other fine grain graphite are inadequate. Its name is derived from the method of production: During the forming process the material is isostatically pressed i.e. with equal pressure from every side. Therefore the material shows typically an isotropic property behavior.

Tellurium copper alloy is a compound Cu2Te formed by tellurium element and copper in the cast state. This compound forms a eutectic with copper at a higher temperature (about 1084 Â° C), and is distributed in the copper matrix in the form of dispersed and soft second phase particles. Among them, the grain refinement can significantly improve the cutting performance of the alloy, and at the same time, the influence on the electrical conductivity is relatively small. Due to the joint effect of dispersion strengthening and grain refinement strengthening, it has an organic combination of excellent thermal conductivity, ductility, strength and other properties, and good cutting performance. In view of its good comprehensive performance, it is used in the fields of electronic information, electrical appliances, transportation and other materials.
